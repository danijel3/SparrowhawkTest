# About the files in this filder

These files were created by Google, for the SLTU 2016. I retrieved it from within the docker, available at:

https://hub.docker.com/r/mjansche/tts-tutorial-sltu2016/

It seems they were compiled from the grammar files available here:

https://github.com/googlei18n/language-resources/tree/master/af/textnorm

The exact method of how these files were created (and how they can be adapted to different languages) is not available at the moment.
