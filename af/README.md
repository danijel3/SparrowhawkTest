# About the files in this folder

These files were created by Google, for the SLTU 2016. They can be fond them in this repository:

https://github.com/mjansche/tts-tutorial/tree/master/usr_local/share/sparrowhawk/af

It seems they were compiled from the grammar files available here:

https://github.com/googlei18n/language-resources/tree/master/af/textnorm

The exact method of how these files were created (and how they can be adapted to different languages) is not available at the moment.
